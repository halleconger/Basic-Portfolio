            Hi, my name is Halle Conger! I graduated from Indiana University with a degree in Public Financial Management this past August.
        </p>
            <br>
            <br>
        <p>
            Since graduating, I have been employed as a Project Accountant and have throughly enjoyed my career path in Finance; however,
            something has seemed to be missing, which stems from the continuing thought of wanting to get into the coding
            and web development field.
        </p>
            <br>
            <br>
        <p>
            That being said, I am extremely excited for this opportunity at Northwestern and am looking foward to learning and developing
            the skills needed in order to become a full-stack developer.
        </p>
